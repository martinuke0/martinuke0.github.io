Google has quietly assembled one of the most **end-to-end AI-native developer ecosystems** on the market—spanning agentic IDEs, autonomous coding agents, no-code workflows, and collaborative AI canvases.

This guide gives you a **practical map of Google’s AI coding stack**, what each tool does, and where it fits.

## Tool Overview

| Tool | Description | Category |
|-----|------------|----------|
| **[Antigravity](https://labs.google/)** | The “Cursor-killer” agentic IDE that builds full apps directly from text prompts. | Agentic IDE |
| **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)** | Prototype MVPs, prompts, and AI apps in seconds using Gemini models. | Vibe Coder |
| **[Opal](https://cloud.google.com/)** | Build no-code AI mini-apps and multi-step workflows using natural language. | No-Code Workflow Builder |
| **[Stitch](https://github.com/google)** | Convert wireframes, sketches, and prompts into clean frontend code. | AI UI Designer |
| **[Jules](https://github.com/google/jules)** | Autonomous coding agent that connects to GitHub to build features and fix bugs. | Autonomous Coding Agent |
| **[Codewiki](https://github.com/google)** | Self-updating GitHub wiki that explains your entire codebase using Gemini. | GitHub Visualizer |
| **[Gemini CLI](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/cli)** | Terminal-based AI pilot to run commands, tests, and manage source control. | Terminal / CLI |
| **[Gemini Code Assist](https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini/code-assist)** | Professional AI pair programmer for VS Code, Cursor, and JetBrains IDEs. | Coding Extension |
| **[Gemini Canvas](https://gemini.google.com/)** | Shared visual workspace for brainstorming, coding, and collaboration with Gemini. | Collaboration |
| **[Data Science Agent](https://cloud.google.com/ai)** | Automates data cleaning, analysis, and visual chart generation. | Data Science |
| **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** | Cloud-hosted Jupyter notebooks for Python, ML, and data science. | Cloud Workspace |
| **[Firebase Studio](https://firebase.google.com/)** | Visual, AI-assisted cockpit for backend data, auth, and cloud logic. | Backend Management |

## How These Tools Fit Together

**Think of Google’s stack in layers:**

- **Idea → UI**
  - Gemini Canvas
  - Stitch
  - Google AI Studio

- **Code → Automation**
  - Antigravity
  - Jules
  - Gemini Code Assist
  - Gemini CLI

- **Data → Intelligence**
  - Data Science Agent
  - Google Colab

- **Backend → Production**
  - Firebase Studio
  - Opal

## Who This Ecosystem Is For

- **Solo founders** building MVPs fast  
- **Vibe coders** who prompt more than they type  
- **Teams** that want autonomous agents wired into GitHub  
- **Data-heavy builders** who want analysis + charts without boilerplate  
- **Enterprises** standardizing on Gemini + Google Cloud  

---

## Final Take

Google is no longer just “adding AI to tools.”  
They’re building a **cohesive agentic development platform**—from idea → code → deploy → maintain.

If Cursor popularized vibe coding, **Google is industrializing it**.
