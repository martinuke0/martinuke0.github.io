## Introduction

Every entrepreneur dreams of building something from nothing and scaling it to billions. But the journey from zero to billions is rarely linear, and it’s almost never easy. Along the way, the right ideas, frameworks, and mental models can make the difference between failure and extraordinary success.

One of the most powerful tools available to founders, CEOs, and business builders is a well-curated reading list. The world’s most successful entrepreneurs and investors didn’t just “figure it out” — they studied, absorbed, and applied the wisdom of those who came before them.

In this post, we’ve compiled a **curated list of the top 100 business books** that can help you go from zero to billions. These books span **entrepreneurship, leadership, strategy, finance, psychology, sales, marketing, and operations** — everything you need to build, scale, and sustain a world-class business.

Whether you’re just starting out or leading a high-growth company, this reading list will give you the mental toolkit to think bigger, execute better, and build something that lasts.

## How This List Was Curated

This list is not just a random aggregation of popular titles. It’s based on:

- Recommendations from top entrepreneurs (Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Mark Cuban, Warren Buffett, etc.)
- Bestseller data and reader ratings (Goodreads, Amazon, Shortform)
- Expert-curated lists (Harvard Business Review, Billion Success, Shortform, Goodreads 100 Best Business Books)
- Books that have repeatedly appeared in “must-read” lists for founders and investors

We’ve organized the list into **10 thematic categories**, each with 10 essential books, so you can focus on the areas most relevant to your stage and goals.
