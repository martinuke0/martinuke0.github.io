## Introduction

Entrepreneurs don’t just need goals; they need sequencing. Your Next Five Moves urges you to anticipate, prepare, and position several steps ahead—like a strategist, not merely a grinder. Below, you’ll find:

- 10 crisp, actionable ideas for each of the five moves
- Simple templates to use immediately (decision journal, role scorecard, KPI tree, and more)
- A final set of 10 takeaways to integrate the book’s philosophy into your daily operating system

Use this as a blueprint to plan your next five moves with clarity and conviction.

## Move 1: Know Yourself and Define the Game (10 ideas)

1. Decide what you are solving for. Be explicit: freedom, power, mastery, impact, wealth, or peace. Your answers set constraints for every subsequent move.
2. Craft a vivid multi-horizon vision. Write your 3-, 5-, and 10-year future in concrete detail: income, team size, products, industry position, personal life, and health.
3. Choose your game. Operator, builder, influencer, investor, or hybrid? Align your daily work with your natural strengths and desired identity.
4. Establish non-negotiables. Define values and boundaries (e.g., integrity, health, family rhythms) so decisions get faster and simpler.
5. Map your motive stack. Rank your true drivers (status, security, service, curiosity, legacy). Design incentives and environments that feed—rather than fight—your motives.
6. Audit your skill stack. List core skills (e.g., sales, product, finance, ops, media). Mark each as build, borrow (advisors), or buy (hire/partner).
7. Set your risk profile and time horizon. High-risk with long runway? Or measured bets with short feedback loops? Calibrate bets to your psychology and season of life.
8. Identify your five enemies. Common culprits: distraction, ego, fear, entitlement, and comfort. Implement countermeasures (focus blocks, mentors, exposure therapy, standards, hormetic stress).
9. Create a personal scoreboard. Track weekly metrics across health, wealth, relationships, and learning. What gets measured compounds.
10. Write a “no” list. Pre-commit to what you won’t do (e.g., no random coffee meetings, no new initiatives before shipping the current one) to protect focus.

> Pro tip: Clarity precedes strategy. If you’re stuck, spend a week journaling and interviewing mentors until your “what” and “why” are unambiguous.

## Move 2: Reasoning and Decision-Making (10 ideas)

1. Think in second- and third-order effects. Always ask “and then what?” Trace downstream consequences before acting.
2. Use expected value (EV). Favor small, repeated bets with asymmetric upside; cap downside with clear limits.
3. Run a pre-mortem. Imagine the initiative failed. List the causes. Turn each into a prevention or detection control.
4. Invert to avoid failure. Ask “How could this go horribly wrong?” Then make those paths unlikely or impossible.
5. Barbell your decision speed. Move fast on reversible decisions; go slow and gather data on irreversible ones.
6. Set kill criteria and stop-losses up front. Predefine conditions that force you to exit a bad path before sunk-cost bias takes over.
7. Keep a decision journal. Capture assumptions, alternatives, chosen path, and predicted outcomes. Review monthly to calibrate judgment.
8. Red-team big moves. Assign a colleague (or outside advisor) to challenge your plan’s assumptions and reveal blind spots.
9. Build checklists for recurring calls. Standardize diligence for hires, partnerships, and pricing to reduce variance.
10. Apply the 80/20 rule relentlessly. Identify the few inputs creating most of your outcomes; double down, prune the rest.

Decision Journal Template (copy/paste and use today):

```text
Decision: [Title and date]
Context: [Why now? What’s the opportunity/threat?]
Options considered: [A, B, C]
Assumptions (ranked by uncertainty): [...]
Primary risks and mitigations: [...]
Expected value (qualitative/quantitative): [...]
Second-order effects: [...]
Kill criteria / stop-loss: [...]
Decision owner: [...]
Prediction (be specific): [If we choose A, by [date], we expect X metric to move from Y to Z]
Review dates: [30, 90, 180 days]
Outcome notes (filled later): [...]
Calibration lessons: [...]
```

## Move 3: Build the Right Team (10 ideas)

1. Hire for slope, not just intercept. Prioritize learning velocity and resilience over today-only skill.
2. Define roles with scorecards. Clarify mission, outcomes, competencies, and KPIs before interviewing.
3. Be explicit about culture. Write the 5-7 behaviors that get promoted (and those that get you benched).
4. Create an A-player recruiting system. Always be sourcing; set weekly candidate goals; protect interview quality.
5. Onboard with 30/60/90 plans. Specify deliverables, training, and relationship-building milestones.
6. Run tight feedback loops. Weekly 1:1s focused on outcomes, obstacles, and growth commitments.
7. Coach up or part ways fast. When values or standards aren’t met, act quickly and fairly; ambiguity kills morale.
8. Align pay to value creation. Blend base, performance incentives, and long-term upside to match your business model.
9. Build a leadership bench. Identify successors, cross-train, and delegate decisions with clear guardrails.
10. Systematize everything repeatable. SOPs, checklists, and templates free up time for creative and strategic work.

Role Scorecard Template:

```markdown
# Role: [Title]
Mission: [One sentence on why this role exists]

## Move 4: Strategy to Scale (10 ideas)

1. Cascade strategy from vision to execution. Link vision → positioning → business model → operating system → daily actions.
2. Carve a sharp position. Own a specific promise for a specific audience. Be meaningfully different, not incrementally better.
3. Obsess over unit economics. Know contribution margins, LTV, CAC, payback period, and cash conversion cycles cold.
4. Master one primary distribution channel before diversifying. Depth beats breadth early; breadth builds resilience later.
5. Build an operating cadence. Instituting weekly business reviews (WBRs), monthly strategy resets, and quarterly offsites creates momentum and alignment.
6. Standardize and automate. Document SOPs, implement checklists, and use software to reduce errors and cost per transaction.
7. Architect your KPI tree. Define a north-star metric and break it down into controllable drivers and input metrics.
8. Allocate capital like a portfolio. Place multiple small bets, double down on winners, sunset laggards with discipline.
9. Attack bottlenecks systematically. Use the Theory of Constraints: identify, exploit, subordinate, elevate, repeat.
10. Invest in moats. Brand, network effects, switching costs, data advantages, and exclusive distribution protect margins as you scale.

Example KPI Tree (for a subscription business):

```text
North Star: Net Revenue Growth
├─ New MRR
│  ├─ Leads Generated
│  │  ├─ Channel A traffic
│  │  └─ Channel B traffic
│  ├─ Lead-to-Trial Conversion Rate
│  ├─ Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate
│  └─ Average Selling Price
└─ Churn
   ├─ Involuntary Churn Rate
   ├─ Voluntary Churn Rate
   └─ Activation Rate (Day 7)
```

## Move 5: Power Plays and Competitive Leverage (10 ideas)

1. Accumulate leverage. Build and combine capital, code, media, talent, and distribution to bend the game in your favor.
2. Maintain optionality. Keep credible alternatives (BATNAs) in fundraising, partnerships, and hiring to strengthen your negotiating position.
3. Control the frame. Shape how your offer and category are perceived (price anchors, social proof, guarantees, scarcity).
4. Manage timing and tempo. Sequence product launches, announcements, and partnerships to maximize pressure and momentum.
5. Win the narrative war. Use content, PR, and thought leadership to define the category and attract outsized opportunity.
6. Build alliances and coalitions. Partner to isolate competitors, expand distribution, and co-create moats.
7. Know the legal terrain. Use contracts, IP, compliance, and risk shields as strategic assets, not mere hygiene.
8. Employ decoys and flanks. Introduce decoy packages, flanking features, or segments to redirect competitor energy.
9. Orchestrate pattern interrupts. Surprise the market with a bold move (pricing, bundling, acquisition) that resets expectations.
10. Plan your exits in advance. Identify strategic acquirers, prepare data rooms, and design earn-out structures before you need them.

Power Map Worksheet:

```text
Goal: [e.g., Win enterprise accounts in Industry X]
Stakeholders:
- Customers: [Economic buyer, technical buyer, end users]
- Influencers: [Analysts, media, partners]
- Gatekeepers: [Procurement, legal]
- Competitors: [Top 3; strengths/weaknesses]
Leverage Assets:
- Proof: [Case studies, metrics]
- Access: [Warm intros, channel partners]
- Narrative: [Category POV, key messages]
- Offers: [Pricing levers, terms, guarantees]
Plays (sequenced):
1) Publish POV + case study
2) Partner webinar with Channel Y
3) Enterprise bundle with time-limited terms
4) Reference calls with marquee clients
Countermoves (if competitor responds with price cuts):
- Add value via services
- Offer multi-year discount with prepay
- Highlight TCO and switching costs

## Conclusion: 10 Big-Picture Takeaways for the Whole Book

1. Clarity precedes strategy. You can’t plan five moves ahead until you decide what game you’re playing and why.
2. Think in probabilities, not certainties. Decision quality compounds when you track assumptions, EV, and second-order effects.
3. Talent is the ultimate force multiplier. Systems + A-players outperform hacks and heroics every time.
4. Culture is your invisible operating system. Make your standards explicit and coach to them daily.
5. Focus beats frenzy. Concentrate on a few leverage points—distribution, unit economics, and moats—to scale sustainably.
6. Sequence matters. The right move at the wrong time is the wrong move; design the order of operations deliberately.
7. Build repeatable mechanisms. Checklists, SOPs, operating cadences, and KPI trees create compounding predictability.
8. Narrative moves markets. Positioning, framing, and media presence don’t just reflect reality—they help create it.
9. Protect the downside, earn the upside. Kill criteria, stop-losses, and optionality make you anti-fragile.
10. Always be five moves ahead. Scenario plan likely futures, prepare countermoves, and keep your leverage powder dry.

If you adopt even a handful of the 60 ideas above (50 by move + 10 concluding), you’ll operate with more clarity, momentum, and leverage. Entrepreneurs don’t win by chance—they win by sequence. Plan your next five moves now, and the next five will reveal themselves.
