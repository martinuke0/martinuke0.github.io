## What Are Guardrails?

**Guardrails are longitudinal, roadside barrier systems designed to prevent errant vehicles from impacting roadside obstacles and to protect workers from falls and collisions.** These essential safety structures serve as semi-flexible barriers that move or bend when hit, deflecting impacts up to 5 feet while maintaining structural integrity. Beyond roadways, guardrails are critical safety components in industrial facilities, construction sites, warehouses, and elevated work platforms.

The primary function of guardrails extends across multiple environments. In traffic contexts, they shield motorists from natural and man-made obstacles. In industrial and construction settings, they protect workers from falls, collisions with equipment, and damage to facilities. The versatility of guardrail systems makes them indispensable across virtually every industry that prioritizes worker safety and accident prevention.

## Types of Guardrails

### W-Beam Guardrails

W-beam guardrails are the most common type of guardrail in use today. These **"W" shaped barriers are manufactured with galvanized steel and feature a symmetrical design that spreads the pressure of vehicle impact across the beam's profile.** The strong-post W-beam guardrail consists of wood posts with wood blockouts or steel posts with wood or plastic blockouts. These blockouts reduce or minimize vehicle snagging on posts upon impact.

W-beam guardrails are standard for highways and bridge applications, offering reliable protection at moderate cost. They're fabricated with zinc coatings and weather-resistant materials to protect against environmental conditions. The design makes them ideal for high-traffic areas where consistent performance is required.

### Thrie-Beam Guardrails

For applications requiring stronger protection than standard W-beams, **thrie-beam guardrails offer a three-wave or cross-section design that provides greater strength and impact resistance.** These guardrails are particularly suitable for flyovers and roads with dangerous curves where vehicle containment is critical. The additional strength comes from the multiple wave design, which distributes impact forces more effectively than traditional W-beams.

### Box-Beam Guardrails

Box-beam guardrails provide **anti-rust, corrosion-resistant protection with a durable, well-constructed design built for long service life.** These guardrails can be configured as square or rectangular shapes, and some are available in open box beam designs depending on specific requirements. Box-beam guardrails can be used with or without blocks and are easy to install and repair with minimal maintenance needs. They're commonly used on bridges and in applications requiring maximum durability.

### Cable Barriers

Cable barriers represent a **flexible barrier system designed to move when hit, with deflection capabilities up to 7 feet.** These systems are increasingly popular for highway applications where flexibility and vehicle containment are priorities. The cable design allows for significant energy absorption while redirecting vehicles safely away from obstacles.

### Polymer Guardrails

Also called pedestrian safety barriers, **polymer guardrails are made from impact-resistant material and are commonly found in parking areas, warehouses, and factories.** These guardrails are not suitable for outdoor highway usage but excel in indoor industrial environments where aesthetics and durability matter. Their lightweight nature and resistance to corrosion make them ideal for facilities requiring frequent cleaning or exposure to moisture.

### Steel Ribbed Rails

Steel ribbed rails feature **raised or ridged lines on their surfaces, providing additional strength and visual distinction.** These rails are constructed from strong steel and offer reliable protection in various industrial applications. The ribbed design increases surface area for better gripping and structural support.

### Wood Guardrails

**Wood guardrails offer safety with aesthetic appeal, blending naturally with their surroundings.** These are commonly placed in parks, scenic roads, and residential areas where visual harmony with the environment is important. While wood provides excellent aesthetic value, it requires more maintenance than metal alternatives to ensure longevity and safety compliance.

### Concrete Barriers

Concrete barriers represent the **rigid barrier option designed not to move when hit.** These are used to protect critical infrastructure such as bridge columns or retaining walls. While they offer maximum protection against vehicle impact, they provide no deflection and are typically used in specialized applications requiring absolute obstacle protection.

### Specialty Roof Guardrails

For building applications, **metal roof mounts accommodate three primary roof types: standing seam, corrugated metal, and R panel roofs.** Standing seam guardrails feature roof clamps for various standing seam rooftops, while corrugated metal roof mounts adhere directly to roof folds, distributing force over a wide area. Architectural non-penetrating guardrails curve away from the roof's edge to maintain visual appeal, and collapsible guardrails feature one-way pivot systems that fold when not in use.
