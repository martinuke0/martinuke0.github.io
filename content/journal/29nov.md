Maybe you are not lazy to start a new business, maybe you are just afraid to be too successfull.
Maybe you are your greatest enemy and should conspire more for your own good.

You need to sleep and need to plan for your future because this is a not a sprint, is a marathon.
You're giving everything you've got today to be perfect, but tomorrow is another day to try again.
