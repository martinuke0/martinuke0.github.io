Maybe you are not lazy to start a new business, maybe you are just afraid to be too successfull.
Maybe you are your greatest enemy and should conspire more for your own good.

---

You need to sleep and need to plan for your future because this is a not a sprint, is a marathon.
You're giving everything you've got today to be perfect, but tomorrow is another day to try again.

---

You give your children broccoli because you don't want to be nice to them today, you want to be nice 
to their future self. Also be nice to your future self, do something your future self would thank you
